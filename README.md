# Bicep Development Container
This is a complete development container environment showing how to create a Bicep Development Container for VS Code or Codespaces. A walkthrough of the details is provided on my blog: https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/devcontainers-codespaces-and-bicep-oh-my.

The environment itself is a standalone Dev Container, capable of running in a local VS Code environment or in Codespaces. A sample Bicep file is included which can be used in the environment. Once the container is available, it can take several minutes for VS Code to install all of the required extensions and enable them.
